Website UI
=====
Created a basic website UI for our project.
##### Things to note:
* We are using the Google Maps API for the location of the user / routers.
It needs a longitude and latitude.
* I am not planning on using jQuerry at this point but we can use it later as
an extended goal
* Everything is gray right now as we didn't decide on a color scheme
* Feel free to fork it and make any design change if you want

PCap
=====
Added a trivial pcap program with a capture file.

Outbreak
=====

Outbreak is a tool to monitor and display traceroutes using geolocation on IP addresses.

Easy Setup With Docker
-----

Manual Setup
-----
**This is just a test beep boop**

If you don't have pip installed you'll need to get it now
```
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip 
```

We don't want to pollute your environment so install virtualenv
```
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv env
$ source ./env/bin/activate
```

Now we can safely install our deps
```
$ ./env/bin/python install -r requirements.txt
```
