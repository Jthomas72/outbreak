Easy Setup With Docker

Manual Setup
-----
**This is just a test beep boop**

If you don't have pip installed you'll need to get it now
```
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip 
```

We don't want to pollute your environment so install virtualenv
```
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv env
$ source ./env/bin/activate
```

Now we can safely install our deps
```
$ ./env/bin/python install -r requirements.txt
```
